<div class="col-10 col-md-11">
<p>localdrive has made it place on June 24, 2022 at 19:50. How? Me (expit, founder of ld) was a co-owner of TIXBUX, which is also a revival, called owner (Toober93) as a kid. HE GOT MAD AF LMAO and banned everyone. Samily12 said on announcements: "he in the process, betrayed and backstabbed all the people who dedicated their hardwork to making tixbux possible! he as a result, has been removed from this server as a consequence for his actions!" I immediately renamed my website from tixbux to localdrive.</p>
